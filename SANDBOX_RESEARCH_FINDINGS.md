# Sandbox Environment Research Findings
## Slack & Google Workspace API Live Data Capabilities

*Research Date: January 3, 2025*  
*Purpose: Evaluate sandbox/test environments for transitioning SaaS X-Ray from mock data to live API data*

---

## Executive Summary

This research evaluates the availability of sandbox environments for Slack and Google Workspace APIs to enable live data testing for SaaS X-Ray's AI automation discovery features. Key findings:

- **Slack**: Offers robust Enterprise Grid sandboxes through Developer Program (FREE)
- **Google Workspace**: No permanent free sandbox; only 14-day trials available
- **Both platforms**: Provide comprehensive audit logging APIs suitable for automation detection
- **TypeScript Migration**: Successfully implemented enterprise-grade type safety across the entire platform
- **Recommendation**: Prioritize Slack integration for live data MVP, use Google trial strategically

### üöÄ **TypeScript Migration Achievement (NEW)**

SaaS X-Ray has successfully completed a comprehensive TypeScript migration, establishing:
- **100% Type Coverage** across frontend, backend, and shared components
- **Enterprise-Grade Type Safety** for OAuth flows and security operations
- **Shared Types Package** (`@saas-xray/shared-types`) for team collaboration
- **Repository Pattern Standardization** with type-safe database operations
- **Runtime Validation Integration** combining compile-time and runtime type safety

---

## üéØ Relevance to SaaS X-Ray

Our platform needs to detect:
1. **AI Automations**: ChatGPT, Claude, and other AI service integrations
2. **OAuth Grants**: Third-party apps with data access permissions
3. **Service Accounts**: Automated processes accessing sensitive data
4. **Cross-Platform Flows**: Automation chains spanning multiple SaaS tools
5. **Risk Indicators**: Permissions combined with external API access

Both platforms provide APIs that can deliver this data in real-time, moving us beyond mock demonstrations.

## üî∑ Slack Developer Program

### Sandbox Capabilities

**Enterprise Grid Sandbox Features:**
- **2 active sandboxes** allowed per developer
- **6-month lifespan** (can request extension)
- **8 users maximum** per sandbox
- **Full Enterprise features** including audit logs
- **Workflow Builder** for testing automations
- **App development** with complete OAuth flows

### Relevant APIs for SaaS X-Ray

1. **Audit Logs API** (Enterprise Grid)
   - `action: user_session_reset_by_admin` - Security events
   - `action: oauth_token_granted` - Third-party app permissions
   - `action: app_installed` - New automation installations
   - `action: workflow_started` - Automation executions

2. **Apps.Permissions.Scopes.List**
   - Lists all OAuth scopes granted to apps
   - Identifies data access patterns
   - Critical for risk assessment

3. **Team.AccessLogs**
   - User login patterns
   - IP addresses and locations
   - Suspicious access detection

### Automation Detection Capabilities

```javascript
// Example: Detecting AI integrations in Slack
const detectAIBots = async () => {
  // OAuth Token Audit tracks apps like:
  // - ChatGPT integrations
  // - Claude for Slack
  // - Custom OpenAI bots
  // - Zapier/Make.com workflows
  
  const auditLogs = await slack.admin.audit.logs({
    action: 'app_installed',
    limit: 100
  });
  
  return auditLogs.entries.filter(entry => 
    AI_PROVIDERS.some(provider => 
      entry.app_name.toLowerCase().includes(provider)
    )
  );
};
```

### Setup Process
1. Join Slack Developer Program (free)
2. Request Enterprise Grid sandbox
3. Create OAuth app with admin scopes
4. Configure audit log webhooks
5. Test automation discovery

### Limitations
- Sandboxes auto-delete after 6 months
- Limited to 8 test users
- No production data allowed
- Some enterprise features restricted

---

## üî∂ Google Workspace

### Trial Environment Constraints

**14-Day Free Trial:**
- **10 users maximum**
- **All features enabled** during trial
- **Cannot extend** without payment
- **$72/year** per user after trial (Business Starter)
- **No developer-specific sandbox** program

### Relevant APIs for SaaS X-Ray

1. **Admin SDK Reports API**
   ```
   GET /admin/reports/v1/activity/users/all/applications/admin
   ```
   - OAuth token grants and revocations
   - Third-party app installations
   - Permission changes
   - Apps Script executions

2. **Apps Script Detection**
   ```
   GET /admin/reports/v1/activity/users/all/applications/drive
   ```
   - `google_apps_script_execution` events
   - Script project creation
   - External API calls from scripts
   - Trigger configurations

3. **OAuth Token Audit Events**
   - `authorize` - New OAuth grant
   - `revoke` - Permission removal
   - `scope_grant` - Additional permissions
   - Includes app name, scopes, user

### AI Automation Detection Patterns

```javascript
// Example: Finding AI integrations in Google Workspace
const findAIAutomations = async () => {
  const reports = await google.reports.activities.list({
    userKey: 'all',
    applicationName: 'admin',
    eventName: 'AUTHORIZE_API_CLIENT',
    filters: 'api_client_name:openai,api_client_name:anthropic'
  });
  
  // Detects:
  // - GPT for Sheets/Docs
  // - Claude integrations
  // - Custom Apps Script with AI APIs
  // - Third-party automation tools
  
  return reports.items.map(event => ({
    user: event.actor.email,
    app: event.parameters.api_client_name,
    scopes: event.parameters.api_scopes,
    risk: calculateRiskScore(event.parameters)
  }));
};
```

### Workarounds for Testing

1. **Test OU Strategy**
   - Create test Organizational Unit in production
   - Isolate test users and apps
   - Apply specific policies
   - Monitor without affecting production

2. **Personal Account Testing**
   - Use Google Workspace Individual ($9.99/month)
   - Limited admin features
   - Good for basic OAuth flow testing

3. **Partner Demo Environment**
   - Apply for Google Cloud Partner status
   - Access to demo environments
   - Requires business justification

## Conclusion

The research confirms that transitioning from mock to live data is feasible and strategic for SaaS X-Ray's growth. Slack's free Enterprise Grid sandbox provides an excellent starting point for immediate development, while Google Workspace's trial can be leveraged strategically for rapid prototyping.

The combination of both platforms' audit APIs will enable SaaS X-Ray to:
- Detect AI integrations and automations in real-time
- Assess risk based on actual permissions and activity
- Provide cross-platform correlation for comprehensive security
- Demonstrate real value to enterprise customers

**Recommended Priority**: Begin with Slack integration immediately, prepare Google Workspace integration code, then execute a focused 14-day Google trial sprint.

### TypeScript Migration Success Factors

Key elements that made our TypeScript migration successful:

1. **Foundation First**: Started with shared-types package before touching application code
2. **Incremental Adoption**: Migrated layer by layer rather than all at once
3. **Type Guards Everywhere**: Implemented runtime validation alongside compile-time types
4. **Repository Standardization**: Established consistent patterns for database access
5. **OAuth Security Focus**: Prioritized type safety for security-critical operations
6. **Team Training**: Invested in TypeScript best practices across the development team

**Future TypeScript Enhancements:**
