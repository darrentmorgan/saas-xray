- [ ] Proper indexing for database queries
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate
- [ ] Minimal re-renders in React components

### Type Safety
- [ ] Proper TypeScript types (no 'any' unless justified)
- [ ] Type definitions for API contracts
- [ ] Validated runtime types where needed

### Testing
- [ ] Adequate test coverage for new code
- [ ] Edge cases covered in tests

## Review Output Format

For each issue found, provide:

1. **Severity**: Critical | High | Medium | Low
2. **Location**: File path and line number
3. **Issue**: Clear description of the problem
4. **Impact**: Why this matters
5. **Recommendation**: Specific fix with code example
6. **Learning**: Brief explanation for educational value

## Example Review

```markdown
### Issue 1: SQL Injection Vulnerability
**Severity**: Critical
**Location**: src/api/users.ts:45
**Issue**: User input directly concatenated into SQL query
**Impact**: Allows arbitrary SQL execution, potential data breach
**Recommendation**:
```typescript
// Bad
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`;

// Good
const { data, error } = await supabase
  .from('users')
  .select('*')
  .eq('email', email);
```
**Learning**: Always use parameterized queries or ORM methods to prevent SQL injection.
```

## Guidelines

- Be constructive, not critical
- Provide specific examples
- Explain the 'why' behind recommendations
- Acknowledge good practices when you see them
- Focus on high-impact issues first
- Consider project context and constraints
