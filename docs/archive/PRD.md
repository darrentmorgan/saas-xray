# SaaS X-Ray Product Requirements Document

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** January 2025  
**Author:** Product Team  
**Status:** Draft

---

## Executive Summary

SaaS X-Ray is an enterprise security platform that automatically discovers and monitors unauthorized AI agents, bots, and automations running across an organization's SaaS applications. The platform provides real-time visibility into shadow AI usage, enabling security teams to identify risks before they become compliance violations or security breaches.

**Market Opportunity:** $2.3B shadow IT security market growing at 23% CAGR, with 89% of enterprises reporting unauthorized SaaS usage.

---

## Problem Statement

### The Shadow AI Crisis

Modern enterprises are experiencing an explosion of unauthorized AI and automation tools:

**Scale of the Problem:**
- Average enterprise has 50-200 unauthorized bots/automations
- 78% of companies have no visibility into AI tool usage
- 45% of security breaches involve unauthorized SaaS applications
- Compliance violations increase 300% with unmanaged automation

**Specific Pain Points:**

1. **Invisible AI Usage**
   - Sales teams using ChatGPT integrations in Slack
   - Marketing running undocumented HubSpot workflows
   - Support using unauthorized Jira automation bots
   - Finance creating Google Apps Script automations

2. **Security Risks**
   - Bots accessing sensitive customer data
   - AI tools storing data in unknown locations
   - Cross-platform data sharing without oversight
   - Privileged access granted to automated systems

3. **Compliance Gaps**
   - GDPR violations from untracked data processing
   - SOC2 audit failures due to undocumented systems
   - Missing Article 30 records for automated processing
   - No audit trail for bot activities

4. **Operational Blindness**
   - IT teams unaware of automation dependencies
   - No risk assessment for installed bots
   - Security policies bypassed by automation
   - Incident response complicated by unknown systems

### Why Current Solutions Fail

- **CASB tools** focus on file sharing, not automation detection
- **SIEM platforms** lack SaaS-specific automation context
- **Manual audits** are too slow and incomplete
- **OAuth dashboards** show apps but not automation behavior

---

## Solution Overview

### Core Value Proposition

> "Discover every bot, AI agent, and automation in your SaaS stack in under 60 seconds. Get the visibility you need to secure your organization's shadow AI usage."

### Key Differentiators

1. **Automation-First Detection** - Specifically designed to find bots and AI agents
2. **Cross-Platform Correlation** - Maps automation chains across multiple SaaS tools  
3. **Real-Time Monitoring** - Continuous discovery of new automations
4. **Risk-Based Prioritization** - Focus on highest-risk automations first
5. **Compliance Ready** - Generate audit reports and evidence packages
