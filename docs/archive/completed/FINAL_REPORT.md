## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Authentication Flow (Verified Working)

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[User visits /dashboard] --> B{Clerk: isSignedIn?}
    B -->|No| C[Redirect to /login]
    B -->|Yes| D[Show Dashboard]
    C --> E[User signs in]
    E --> F[Clerk manages session]
    F --> G[Redirect to /dashboard]
    G --> D
```

### Organization-Scoped OAuth (Configured)

```typescript
// PlatformCard.tsx - VERIFIED IN CODE
const { organization } = useOrganization();

const handleConnect = async () => {
  const orgId = organization?.id; // Clerk org ID: "org_2abc..."
  
  if (!orgId) {
    showError('Please create or join an organization first');
    return;
  }
  
  // OAuth includes organization context
  const authUrl = await initiateOAuth(platform, orgId);
  window.location.href = authUrl;
};
```

This ensures all OAuth connections are properly scoped to the user's Clerk organization.
