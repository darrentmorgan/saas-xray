## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**FR1**: The enhanced signal detection engine shall analyze Google Workspace metadata for inhuman interaction patterns including email sending at unusual hours (e.g., Saturday 11pm), rapid file operations, and batch processing behaviors.

**FR2**: The system shall detect OAuth connections to known AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, HuggingFace) through Apps Script external API calls and service account integrations.

**FR3**: The AI validation layer shall integrate with GPT-5 (or equivalent LLM) to analyze detected signals and classify them as "automation risk," "approved activity," or "noise" with confidence scores.

**FR4**: The system shall present validated shadow network risks on the existing dashboard with clear risk categorization and supporting evidence.

**FR5**: Users shall be able to provide feedback on detection accuracy through approve/ignore/flag actions directly from the dashboard interface.

**FR6**: The feedback loop shall incorporate user responses to improve detection algorithm accuracy over time through machine learning optimization.

**FR7**: The system shall maintain cross-platform correlation between Google Workspace and Slack activities to identify automation chains spanning multiple platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements

**NFR1**: Enhancement must maintain existing performance characteristics and not exceed current API response times by more than 500ms for detection processing.

**NFR2**: AI validation calls to external LLMs must include rate limiting, timeout handling, and graceful degradation when external services are unavailable.

**NFR3**: Signal detection processing must handle enterprise-scale data volumes (10,000+ events/hour) without impacting existing automation discovery performance.

**NFR4**: User feedback data must be stored securely with audit logging and comply with existing GDPR and SOC2 requirements.

**NFR5**: The enhanced detection system must be configurable per organization to accommodate different risk tolerance levels and business contexts.

### Compatibility Requirements

**CR1**: Existing APIs remain unchanged - all current automation discovery and risk scoring endpoints maintain backward compatibility.

**CR2**: Database schema changes are backward compatible - new detection and feedback tables do not affect existing automation, connection, or audit data structures.

**CR3**: UI/UX consistency - new shadow network detection features follow existing dashboard patterns, component library, and design system.

**CR4**: Integration compatibility - existing Google Workspace and Slack OAuth connections continue functioning without modification or re-authorization.

## User Interface Enhancement Goals

### Integration with Existing UI

The new shadow network detection features will integrate seamlessly with SaaS X-Ray's existing professional dashboard design patterns:

- **Component Library**: Utilize existing shadcn/ui components and TailwindCSS styling for consistency
- **Layout Structure**: New detection results will fit within current dashboard grid system and sidebar navigation
- **Design Language**: Maintain existing risk visualization patterns (color coding, icons, status indicators)
- **Responsive Design**: Follow current mobile/tablet optimization patterns for executive access

### Modified/New Screens and Views

**Enhanced Dashboard Views**:
1. **Risk Intelligence Panel** (new section on main dashboard) - AI-validated threat summary
2. **Shadow Network Visualization** (new tab/view) - Cross-platform automation correlation display
3. **Detection Feedback Interface** (modal/sidebar) - User validation and feedback collection
4. **Algorithm Tuning Settings** (settings page enhancement) - Organization-specific detection configuration

**Modified Existing Views**:
1. **Automations List** - Enhanced with AI confidence scores and validation status
2. **Platform Connections** - Added shadow network correlation indicators
3. **Security Overview** - Integrated AI-validated risk assessment

### UI Consistency Requirements

**Visual Consistency**:
- **Risk Indicators**: Extend existing risk level color coding (red/yellow/green) with AI confidence overlays
- **Status Icons**: Use existing icon library for validation states (verified, pending, flagged)
- **Data Tables**: Follow current automation list patterns for new shadow network findings
- **Modal Patterns**: Feedback interfaces use existing modal/drawer component patterns

**Interaction Consistency**:
- **Feedback Actions**: Thumb up/down or approve/ignore buttons follow existing action button styles
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex AI analysis details hidden by default, expandable like current risk factor lists
- **Search/Filter**: Shadow network results integrate with existing search and filtering functionality

## Technical Constraints and Integration Requirements

### Existing Technology Stack

**Languages**: TypeScript (99% migration complete), Node.js 20+, React 18.2+

## Epic and Story Structure

### Epic Approach

**Epic Structure Decision**: Single comprehensive epic with rationale.

Based on my analysis of your existing project, I believe this enhancement should be structured as a **single comprehensive epic** because:

1. **Technical Cohesion**: All three layers (Signal → AI → Feedback) are tightly integrated and share data models
2. **User Journey**: The complete shadow network detection experience requires all layers to deliver full value
3. **BMAD Alignment**: This maps to one P1 revenue driver in your business strategy
4. **Risk Management**: Coordinated rollout ensures system integrity throughout implementation

The epic will be sequenced in three phases corresponding to your layer approach, allowing for validation and rollback at each stage.

## Epic 1: Advanced Shadow Network Detection System

**Epic Goal**: Implement sophisticated multi-layer shadow network detection that enhances existing automation discovery with AI-powered pattern validation and continuous learning capabilities, positioning SaaS X-Ray as the market leader in intelligent shadow IT threat detection.

**Integration Requirements**:
- Build on existing Google Workspace and Slack OAuth integrations
- Enhance current detection algorithms (VelocityDetector, BatchOperationDetector, AIProviderDetector, OffHoursDetector)
- Integrate with existing @saas-xray/shared-types architecture and Socket.io real-time infrastructure
- Maintain backward compatibility with current customer deployments
