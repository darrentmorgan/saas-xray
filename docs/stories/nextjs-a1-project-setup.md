# Story A1: NextJS Project Setup and Configuration - Parallel Track A

## User Story

As a **Sales Engineer needing professional demo URLs**,
I want **a NextJS 14 foundation with proper TypeScript and build configuration**,
so that **we have a clean deployment foundation that eliminates current build failures and enables professional hosting**.

## Story Context

**Parallel Track**: A (Frontend Foundation) - **Independent execution**
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Coordinates with**: Track B (backend) and Track C (infrastructure) for final integration

**Existing System Integration**:
- **Integrates with**: Current @saas-xray/shared-types architecture
- **Technology**: NextJS 14, TypeScript, TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui
- **Follows pattern**: Preserve existing component architecture and design system
- **Touch points**: Build system, deployment configuration, type safety

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

**1**: NextJS 14 project initialized with App Router, TypeScript configuration, and TailwindCSS setup maintaining compatibility with existing shadcn/ui design system

**2**: @saas-xray/shared-types integration configured and functioning with NextJS build system enabling type safety across frontend components

**3**: Basic App Router structure created with placeholder pages for dashboard, connections, automations, and authentication flows

### Integration Requirements

**4**: Development environment provides hot reloading, TypeScript checking, and component development workflow equivalent to current Vite setup

**5**: Build configuration eliminates current TypeScript compilation failures while maintaining type safety and shared-types integration

**6**: Foundation structure prepared for parallel Track B (API routes) and Track C (infrastructure) integration without blocking other development

### Quality Requirements

**7**: NextJS project builds successfully without TypeScript errors and deploys to clean Vercel URL
**8**: Component development workflow maintains existing development velocity and debugging capabilities
**9**: Foundation supports existing component patterns and state management approaches

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create new NextJS project alongside existing system for parallel development
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Preserve current component architecture and design system patterns
- **Key Constraints**: Must not interfere with current system operation during development

## Definition of Done

- [ ] NextJS 14 project with App Router successfully initialized
- [ ] TypeScript and @saas-xray/shared-types integration working
- [ ] TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui configured and functional
- [ ] Basic page structure created for main dashboard sections
- [ ] Development environment provides equivalent DX to current Vite setup
- [ ] Project builds and deploys to Vercel without errors
- [ ] Foundation ready for component migration in Story A2
- [ ] No interference with current production system operation

**Estimated Effort**: 2-4 hours
**Track**: A (Frontend) - Independent execution
**Can execute simultaneously with**: Track B (Backend) and Track C (Infrastructure)
