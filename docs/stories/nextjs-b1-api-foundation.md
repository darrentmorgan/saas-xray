# Story B1: NextJS API Routes Foundation - Parallel Track B

## User Story

As a **Customer Success Manager needing reliable backend APIs**,
I want **NextJS API routes foundation with enterprise security and performance**,
so that **customer automation discovery and OAuth flows have global edge performance and reliability**.

## Story Context

**Parallel Track**: B (Backend Migration) - **Independent execution**
**Dependencies**: None (can start immediately)
**Coordinates with**: Track A (frontend) for API consumption and Track C (infrastructure) for database integration

**Existing System Integration**:
- **Integrates with**: Current Express.js API endpoints and OAuth patterns
- **Technology**: NextJS API routes, NextAuth.js, @saas-xray/shared-types
- **Follows pattern**: Preserve existing API contracts and security patterns
- **Touch points**: OAuth flows, automation discovery, GPT-5 AI validation

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements

**1**: NextJS API routes foundation established with basic endpoint structure (/api/health, /api/status) providing identical response formats to current Express endpoints

**2**: NextAuth.js authentication system configured for Google Workspace and Slack OAuth providers maintaining existing security standards and credential encryption

**3**: API route middleware configured for enterprise security including CORS, rate limiting, and audit logging equivalent to current Express middleware

### Integration Requirements

**4**: API contract compatibility ensures existing automation discovery and OAuth endpoints maintain identical request/response structures during migration

**5**: @saas-xray/shared-types integration functions correctly with NextJS API routes providing type safety for request/response handling

**6**: Security patterns preserve existing OAuth credential storage, audit logging, and enterprise compliance standards (SOC2, GDPR)

### Quality Requirements

**7**: API routes deploy to Vercel Edge Functions providing global performance optimization and <100ms response times worldwide
**8**: Error handling and logging maintain existing enterprise audit standards with comprehensive error tracking
**9**: API foundation supports parallel Track A (frontend) integration and Track C (database) connection without blocking development

## Technical Notes

- **Integration Approach**: Create NextJS API routes alongside existing Express system for parallel development and testing
- **Existing Pattern Reference**: Preserve OAuth security patterns and API contract structures from current Express implementation
- **Key Constraints**: Must maintain 100% API compatibility for existing frontend and OAuth integrations

## Definition of Done

- [x] NextJS API routes foundation with basic endpoints operational
- [x] NextAuth.js configured for Google Workspace and Slack OAuth
- [x] API middleware providing enterprise security and audit logging
- [x] API contracts maintain 100% compatibility with existing system
- [x] @saas-xray/shared-types integration working with NextJS
- [x] Security standards preserved (OAuth encryption, audit logging)
- [x] API routes deploy to Vercel Edge with global performance
- [x] Foundation ready for automation discovery API migration in Story B2
- [x] No interference with current Express backend operation

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 hours
**Track**: B (Backend) - Independent execution
**Can execute simultaneously with**: Track A (Frontend) and Track C (Infrastructure)
