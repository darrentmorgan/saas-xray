### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Enable professional customer demonstrations through deployed demo environment
- Provide staging environment for customer beta testing and validation
- Establish production environment foundation for enterprise customer deployments
- Eliminate infrastructure management overhead through managed cloud services
- Accelerate customer acquisition through professional deployment capabilities

**Background Context**:
The revolutionary 3-layer Shadow Network Detection System with GPT-5 integration is complete and customer-ready, but currently requires localhost deployment for demonstrations and testing. Enterprise customers expect professional cloud deployment with multiple environments for proper evaluation. The current Docker-based local development creates barriers for customer acquisition and limits sales velocity. Cloud deployment with Supabase + Vercel provides the professional infrastructure foundation needed for rapid enterprise customer acquisition while maintaining the technical excellence achieved through BMAD methodology.
