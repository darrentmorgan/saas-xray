**Impact**: Medium (Feature utilization below targets)
**Business Impact**: Professional tier upgrade rates below projections

**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Conduct extensive customer validation during development
- Design for intuitive UX with progressive disclosure
- Implement comprehensive onboarding and training
- Provide clear ROI demonstrations and case studies
