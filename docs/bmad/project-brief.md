# SaaS X-Ray - BMAD Project Brief

**Business Model Architecture Design (BMAD) Methodology - v1.0**

## Project Overview

### Executive Summary
SaaS X-Ray is an enterprise security platform that automatically discovers and monitors unauthorized AI agents, bots, and automations running across an organization's SaaS applications. The platform provides real-time visibility into shadow AI usage, enabling security teams to identify risks before they become compliance violations or security breaches.

### Business Context
- **Market Size**: $2.3B shadow IT security market growing at 23% CAGR
- **Problem Scale**: Average enterprise has 50-200 unauthorized bots/automations with 78% having no visibility
- **Risk Factor**: 45% of security breaches involve unauthorized SaaS applications
- **Compliance Impact**: 300% increase in violations with unmanaged automation

### Solution Value Proposition
> "Discover every bot, AI agent, and automation in your SaaS stack in under 60 seconds. Get the visibility you need to secure your organization's shadow AI usage."

## Target Market Analysis

### Primary Personas (Revenue Impact)
1. **CISO / Head of Security** (Decision Maker - High Value)
   - Budget Authority: $500K - $5M security spend
   - Pain: Lack of shadow IT visibility, audit pressure
   - Success Metric: Reduced security incidents, audit preparation time

2. **IT Security Analyst** (Daily User - High Volume)
   - Operational Focus: Day-to-day security operations
   - Pain: Manual processes, overwhelming alerts
   - Success Metric: MTTD reduction, investigation efficiency

3. **Compliance Officer** (Validator - High Urgency)
   - Regulatory Focus: GDPR, SOC2, ISO 27001
   - Pain: Manual Article 30 mapping, audit evidence
   - Success Metric: Compliance accuracy, preparation time

### Market Segmentation
- **Enterprise Security** (>5000 employees) - $50K+ ACV potential
- **Mid-Market IT** (1000-5000 employees) - $15K+ ACV potential
- **Compliance-Heavy Industries** (Finance, Healthcare) - Premium pricing

## Revenue Model

### SaaS Pricing Strategy
- **Starter**: $299/month (up to 500 employees, 3 platforms, basic features)
- **Professional**: $999/month (up to 2500 employees, 8 platforms, advanced features)
- **Enterprise**: $2999/month (unlimited employees, all platforms, full features)

### Revenue Projections (12 months)
- **Month 6**: $100K MRR target
- **Year 1**: $1.2M ARR target
- **Customer LTV**: $50K+ average
- **CAC Target**: <$5K (10:1 LTV:CAC ratio)

### Business Model Validation
- **Unit Economics**: Validated through cost of security breach prevention ($4M+ average)
- **Value Delivery**: Customers discover $50K+ in hidden automation risk
- **Compliance ROI**: $100K-500K annual audit cost savings

## Competitive Landscape

### Direct Competitors
- **Orca Security**: Cloud infrastructure focus (miss SaaS automation)
- **Varonis**: Data security focus (complex, expensive)
- **Netskope CASB**: File sharing focus (miss automation behavior)

### Competitive Advantages
1. **Automation-First Detection** - Purpose-built for bot/AI detection
2. **Cross-Platform Correlation** - Unique automation chain mapping
3. **Time to Value** - Minutes vs. weeks of configuration
4. **Compliance Ready** - Built-in regulatory reporting

### Market Positioning
"The first security platform designed specifically for the shadow AI era - where traditional CASB and SIEM tools fall short."
