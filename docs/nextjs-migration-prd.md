### Goals and Background Context

**Goals**:
- Consolidate 4 fragmented Vercel deployments into single professional enterprise deployment
- Eliminate TypeScript compilation issues preventing reliable deployment
- Enable global edge performance for worldwide enterprise customer access
- Simplify development workflow and deployment process for team scalability
- Maintain 100% feature parity while improving deployment reliability and performance
- Establish professional hosting foundation for enterprise customer acquisition acceleration

**Background Context**:
The revolutionary 3-layer GPT-5 Shadow Network Detection System is complete and customer-ready, but the current Vite + Express architecture creates deployment challenges with fragmented Vercel projects and TypeScript compilation failures. Enterprise customers expect professional, reliable cloud deployment with clean URLs and global performance. NextJS migration solves deployment issues while providing superior edge performance, simplified architecture, and enterprise credibility. This migration directly enables the 200-300% customer acquisition acceleration identified in BMAD analysis by providing the professional hosting infrastructure required for enterprise sales.
