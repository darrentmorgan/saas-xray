# Workflow Artifacts Directory

This directory contains example artifacts generated by the Scout → Plan → Build workflow.

## Purpose

When you run workflow commands (`/scout`, `/plan`, `/build`, `/auto-implement`), artifacts are saved to `.claude/artifacts/` in your **project directory**:

```
your-project/
└── .claude/
    └── artifacts/
        ├── scout-report.md      # From /scout command
        ├── plan.md              # From /plan command
        └── design-notes.md      # From /plan command (optional)
```

**This `/docs/artifacts/` directory** is part of the **template** and contains **example** artifacts for reference.

## Artifact Types

### scout-report.md

Generated by: `/scout` command (scout-agent)

**Purpose**: Identifies minimal files and dependencies for a task

**Contains**:
- Files to modify vs files for context only
- Line/byte ranges for precision
- Dependency relationships
- Key symbols and exports
- Open questions for planner
- Scope estimate

**Example**: See `example-scout-report.md`

---

### plan.md

Generated by: `/plan` command (planner-agent)

**Purpose**: Step-by-step TDD implementation plan

**Contains**:
- Ordered checklist of steps (< 10 typically)
- Failing test to write for each step
- Minimal implementation description
- Agents needed per step
- Token cost estimates
- Risk assessment
- Deferred work (non-critical)
- Rollback strategy

**Example**: See `example-plan.md`

---

### design-notes.md

Generated by: `/plan` command (planner-agent) - optional

**Purpose**: Architectural context and contracts

**Contains**:
- Architecture overview
- API contracts / interfaces
- Data flow diagrams
- Risk areas

**Example**: See `example-design-notes.md`

## Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[/scout] --> B[scout-report.md]
    B --> C[/plan]
    C --> D[plan.md]
    C --> E[design-notes.md]
    D --> F[/build]
    F --> G[Code + Commits]

    style B fill:#e3f2fd
    style D fill:#e8f5e9
    style E fill:#fff3e0
    style G fill:#f3e5f5
```

Or use `/auto-implement` to run all three phases automatically.

## Artifact Lifecycle

### Creation
- Artifacts are created by workflow commands
- Saved to `.claude/artifacts/` in your project

### Usage
- `scout-report.md` → input for `/plan`
- `plan.md` → input for `/build`
- `design-notes.md` → reference for developers

### Cleanup
- Artifacts are **ephemeral** - safe to delete after build completes
- Consider git-ignoring: add `.claude/artifacts/` to `.gitignore`
- Or commit artifacts for team visibility (your choice)

---

## Best Practices

### ✅ Do
- Review scout-report before planning (verify scope is minimal)
- Adjust plan.md if needed before building
- Keep artifacts for future reference (helps with similar tasks)
- Share artifacts in PRs (shows planning process)

### ❌ Don't
- Commit artifacts to version control (unless team agrees)
- Edit artifacts manually unless you understand the format
- Delete artifacts mid-workflow (breaks command chaining)

---

## Customization

### Change Artifact Location

Edit the workflow commands to use a different directory:

**In `scout.md`**:
```markdown
**Output**: `.claude/artifacts/scout-report.md`
```

Change to:
```markdown
**Output**: `.claude/workflow-outputs/scout-report.md`
```

Update all three commands consistently.

---

## Examples

This directory contains example artifacts:

- `example-scout-report.md` - Example Scout output
- `example-plan.md` - Example Plan output
- `example-design-notes.md` - Example design notes

Use these as references when reviewing your own artifacts.
