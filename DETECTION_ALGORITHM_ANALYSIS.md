## 🔍 What We're Currently Detecting

### **Layer 1: Velocity-Based Detection** (velocity-detector.service.ts)

**What it detects**:
- Inhuman event speeds (events per second)
- Rapid file creation/modification
- High-frequency permission changes
- Mass email sending

**Thresholds**:
```typescript
humanMaxFileCreation:      1 event/sec   (60/min)
humanMaxPermissionChanges: 2 events/sec  (120/min)
humanMaxEmailActions:      3 events/sec  (180/min)
automationThreshold:       5 events/sec  (300/min)
criticalThreshold:         10 events/sec (600/min)
```

**Algorithm**:
1. Group events by type (file_create, permission_change, email_send)
2. Calculate time window from first to last event
3. Compute velocity: `events / (timeWindowMs / 1000)`
4. Flag if velocity > threshold for that action type
5. Calculate anomaly score: Linear scale from automation → critical threshold

**Example Detection**:
```
Scenario: Bot creates 150 files in 2 minutes
Velocity: 150 / 120 = 1.25 files/sec
Threshold: 1 file/sec
Result: ✅ DETECTED - Velocity anomaly (confidence: 87%)
```

**Strengths**: ✅ Fast, simple, catches obvious bots
**Weaknesses**: ❌ Can be evaded by throttling (e.g., sleep 1.1 seconds between requests)

---

### **Layer 2: Batch Operation Detection** (batch-operation-detector.service.ts)

**What it detects**:
- Groups of similar actions in short time windows
- Sequential/numbered file naming (file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt)
- Identical permission changes across multiple resources
- Consistent timing intervals between actions

**Thresholds**:
```typescript
minimumSimilarActions: 3    (need at least 3 similar events)
maxTimeWindowMs:       30000 (30 seconds)
similarityThreshold:   0.7   (70% similarity required)
```

**Similarity Checks**:
1. **Action Type**: Same event type (e.g., all file_create)
2. **Resource Type**: Same resource (e.g., all Google Docs)
3. **Naming Pattern**: Sequential numbering detected via regex
4. **Permissions**: Identical permission scopes/roles
5. **Timing**: Consistent intervals (≤5 seconds between events)

**Algorithm**:
1. Sliding window: For each event, look ahead for similar events
2. Calculate similarity score: `matching_checks / total_checks`
3. If ≥70% similar AND ≥3 events → Create batch group
4. Calculate batch likelihood based on timing compression
5. Flag if likelihood > 70%

**Example Detection**:
```
Scenario: Script creates "report_001.pdf", "report_002.pdf", "report_003.pdf" within 15 seconds
Similarity:
  - Action type: ✅ all file_create
  - Resource type: ✅ all PDF files
  - Naming pattern: ✅ sequential (report_NNN)
  - Timing: ✅ 5-second intervals
Similarity score: 100% (4/4 checks)
Result: ✅ DETECTED - Batch operation (confidence: 94%)
```

**Strengths**: ✅ Catches scripted/programmatic patterns
**Weaknesses**: ❌ Misses batches with randomized names/timings, can false-positive on legitimate bulk uploads

---

### **Layer 3: Off-Hours Activity Detection** (off-hours-detector.service.ts)

**What it detects**:
- Activity outside business hours (default: 9 AM - 5 PM, Mon-Fri)
- Weekend activity (configurable by organization)
- Timezone-aware analysis

**Thresholds**:
```typescript
suspiciousActivityThreshold: 30%   (30% off-hours = suspicious)
criticalActivityThreshold:   60%   (60% off-hours = likely automation)
minimumEventsForAnalysis:    10    (need 10+ events)
```

**Algorithm**:
1. Filter events to off-hours using Luxon timezone library
2. Calculate percentage: `offHoursEvents / totalEvents * 100`
3. If ≥30% off-hours → Flag as suspicious
4. Confidence scales linearly from 30% (low) to 60% (critical)

**Example Detection**:
```
Scenario: Service account creates 45 files, 32 outside business hours
Off-hours percentage: 32/45 = 71%
Threshold: 30% (suspicious), 60% (critical)
Result: ✅ DETECTED - Critical off-hours activity (confidence: 95%)
```

**Strengths**: ✅ Catches automated jobs running overnight/weekends
**Weaknesses**: ❌ False positives for global teams, remote workers in different timezones, legitimate after-hours work

---

### **Layer 4: AI Provider Detection** (ai-provider-detector.service.ts)

**What it detects**:
- Direct integrations with OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere APIs
- API endpoint calls in audit logs
- User agent strings (e.g., "OpenAI-Python", "Claude-Integration")
- Content signatures (API keys, model names in scripts)

**Detection Patterns**:
```typescript
OpenAI:
  - Endpoints: api.openai.com, api.chat.openai.com
  - User Agents: OpenAI-Python, ChatGPT-Integration
  - Content: openai_api_key, gpt-3.5-turbo, text-davinci

Anthropic:
  - Endpoints: api.anthropic.com, api.claude.ai
  - User Agents: Anthropic-Python, Claude-Integration
  - Content: anthropic_api_key, claude-v1, claude-v2

Cohere:
  - Endpoints: api.cohere.ai, cohere.com/generate
  - User Agents: Cohere-Python, Cohere-Integration
  - Content: cohere_api_key, cohere.generate
```

**Confidence Scoring**:
```typescript
API Endpoint Match:     40 points (highest weight)
User Agent Match:       30 points
Content Signature:      30 points
---
Total possible: 100 points
```

**Example Detection**:
```
Scenario: Google Apps Script calls api.openai.com with "gpt-3.5-turbo" in payload
Matches:
  - API endpoint: ✅ api.openai.com (40 points)
  - Content signature: ✅ gpt-3.5-turbo (30 points)
Confidence: 70%
Risk Level: HIGH
Result: ✅ DETECTED - OpenAI integration (confidence: 70%)
```

**Strengths**: ✅ Directly identifies AI tool usage
**Weaknesses**: ❌ Only detects 3 providers (missing Gemini, Perplexity, local models), pattern-based (can be obfuscated)

---

### **Layer 5: Cross-Platform Correlation** (cross-platform-correlation.service.ts)

**What it detects**:
- Automation chains spanning multiple platforms (Slack → Google → Jira)
- Data flow patterns (file created in Google, shared in Slack, ticket in Jira)
- User behavior consistency across platforms
- Temporal correlations (events within 5-minute windows)

**Correlation Algorithms**:
1. **Temporal Correlation**: Events within 5-minute time window
2. **Data Flow Correlation**: Same file/data ID across platforms
3. **User Pattern Correlation**: Same user acting across platforms
4. **Context Correlation**: Related business process (e.g., "customer onboarding")

**Thresholds**:
```typescript
timeWindowMs:         300000  (5 minutes)
confidenceThreshold:  0.8     (80% confidence)
maxEventsPerCorrelation: 10000
```

**Example Detection**:
```
Scenario: Automation workflow detected:
  1. File created in Google Drive (10:00 AM)
  2. Same file shared in Slack channel (10:02 AM)
  3. Jira ticket created referencing file (10:04 AM)

Correlation:
  - Temporal: ✅ All within 5-minute window
  - Data Flow: ✅ Same file ID across platforms
  - User: ✅ Same service account
Confidence: 92%
Result: ✅ DETECTED - Cross-platform automation chain (3 stages)
```

**Strengths**: ✅ Unique competitive advantage, catches sophisticated multi-tool workflows
**Weaknesses**: ❌ Requires events from multiple platforms (won't catch single-platform bots), high computational cost

---

### **Layer 6: ML Behavioral Analysis** (ml-enhanced-detection.service.ts)

**What it detects** (current implementation is **simulated**, not real ML):
- Behavioral deviations from organizational baselines
- Sequential patterns in event sequences
- Permission scope anomalies
- Time distribution patterns

**ML Models** (placeholder, not trained):
```typescript
XGBoost (40% weight):  Structured features (frequency, permissions, time)
LSTM (35% weight):     Sequential patterns (event chains, workflows)
GNN (25% weight):      Graph-based relationships (user → resource → action)
```

**Behavioral Features Extracted**:
1. **Automation Frequency**: How often events occur
2. **Permission Scope**: Risk level of permissions requested
3. **Data Access Patterns**: Which resources accessed
4. **Time Distribution**: When activity happens (business hours vs off-hours)
5. **Cross-Platform Activity**: External API calls, integrations

**Example Detection** (simulated):
```
Scenario: Service account with unusual behavior
Features:
  - Automation frequency: 0.9 (very active)
  - Permission scope: 0.7 (elevated permissions)
  - Off-hours: 0.8 (mostly after-hours)
  - Cross-platform: 0.9 (many external calls)

ML Risk Score: 85/100 (high risk)
Result: ⚠️ SIMULATED - Needs real ML training
```

**Strengths**: ✅ Framework in place for advanced detection
**Weaknesses**: ❌ **NOT TRAINED** - currently uses hardcoded rules, needs labeled training data

---

### **Layer 7: Organizational Baseline Learning** (behavioral-baseline-learning.service.ts)

**What it learns**:
- Normal velocity patterns per organization
- Typical business hours for each org
- Common permission patterns
- Standard automation types
- Cross-platform usage patterns

**Baseline Metrics Learned**:
```typescript
normalVelocity: { min, max, average, stdDev }
typicalTimeWindows: { businessHours, peakActivity, offHoursThreshold }
permissionPatterns: { common, risky, complexity }
automationTypes: { commonTypes, riskTypes, distribution }
crossPlatformBehavior: { platformUsage, chains, complexity }
```

**Anomaly Detection**:
- **Velocity Anomaly**: >2 standard deviations from baseline
- **Time Anomaly**: Off-hours when org rarely has off-hours activity
- **Permission Anomaly**: >50% unusual permissions
- **Cross-Platform Anomaly**: External calls when org typically doesn't use them

**Learning Requirements**:
- Minimum 50 historical automations
- 30-day learning period
- 80% confidence threshold
- Weekly baseline updates

**Example Detection**:
```
Scenario: New automation uses permissions never seen before
Baseline: Organization typically uses ["read", "write"] permissions
New automation: Uses ["admin", "delete", "full_control"]
Unusual permissions: 100% (3/3 are new)
Anomaly threshold: 50%
Result: ✅ DETECTED - Permission anomaly (confidence: 85%)
```

**Strengths**: ✅ Personalized per organization, adapts over time
**Weaknesses**: ❌ Requires 50+ events to learn, new orgs have no baseline

---

## ❌ What We're NOT Detecting (Gaps)

### **1. Sophisticated Evasion Techniques**

**Throttling/Rate Limiting Evasion**:
- Bots that sleep 1.1 seconds between requests (just below velocity threshold)
- Randomized timing intervals (defeats batch operation detection)
- Jittered delays (adds random 0-5 second variance)

**Example**:
```python
# Smart bot that evades velocity detection
for file in files:
    create_file(file)
    sleep(1.1)  # Just below 1 file/sec threshold ❌ UNDETECTED
```

**Recommendation**: Add variance analysis - detect unnaturally consistent timing even if slow.

---

### **2. Permission Escalation Attacks**

**What's missing**:
- Gradual privilege escalation (bot gains admin slowly over time)
- Lateral movement (bot accesses more resources than job requires)
- Permission creep detection (permissions never revoked)

**Example Scenario** (undetected):
```
Day 1: Service account requests "read" permission
Day 5: Requests "write" permission
Day 10: Requests "admin" permission
Day 15: Has full domain admin access
❌ UNDETECTED - No escalation monitoring
```

**Recommendation**: Track permission changes over time, flag escalation patterns.

---

### **3. Data Exfiltration Patterns**

**What's missing**:
- Large file downloads (>100 MB)
- Bulk export operations (download 1000s of files)
- External sharing to personal accounts
- Copy-to-external-drive patterns

**Example Scenario** (undetected):
```
Bot downloads 5,000 customer records over 2 hours
Each download: 50 KB (small, below radar)
Total: 250 MB exfiltrated
❌ UNDETECTED - No cumulative size tracking
```

**Recommendation**: Track cumulative data volume per user/day, flag abnormal exports.

---

### **4. Credential Stuffing / Account Takeover**

**What's missing**:
- Failed login attempts from unusual locations
- Multiple accounts accessed from same IP
- Login velocity (same user, 10 locations in 1 hour)
- Session hijacking patterns

**Example Scenario** (undetected):
```
Login from New York at 9:00 AM
Login from Moscow at 9:05 AM (impossible travel)
❌ UNDETECTED - No impossible travel detection
```

**Recommendation**: Add geolocation tracking, impossible travel detection.

---

### **5. Advanced AI Providers**

**Currently detected**: OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere
**Missing**: Gemini, Perplexity, local models (Llama, Mistral), custom fine-tuned models

**Example Scenario** (undetected):
```
Apps Script calls api.google.com/ai/gemini with AI prompts
❌ UNDETECTED - Gemini not in detection patterns
```

**Recommendation**: Expand AI provider patterns, add heuristic detection for unknown LLMs.

---

### **6. Stealth Automation Techniques**

**Human Emulation**:
- Mouse movements (selenium-based bots)
- Randomized click patterns
- Browser automation with real user agents
- CAPTCHA solving

**Example** (undetected):
```
Playwright script with realistic delays:
  - Random mouse movements
  - Human-like typing speed (60-80 WPM)
  - Pauses to "read" content (2-5 seconds)
❌ UNDETECTED - Looks like human behavior
```

**Recommendation**: Add behavioral biometric analysis (typing patterns, mouse entropy).

---

### **7. Low-and-Slow Attacks**

**What's missing**:
- Slow data exfiltration (1 file/hour over 6 months)
- Persistent access (bot checks in once/day)
- Dormant periods (bot active 1 day/month)

**Example Scenario** (undetected):
```
Bot exfiltrates 1 sensitive file every 3 days
After 1 year: 120 files stolen
❌ UNDETECTED - Below all velocity thresholds
```

**Recommendation**: Long-term anomaly tracking, cumulative risk scoring.

---

### **8. Insider Threat Patterns**

**What's missing**:
- Unusual access to sensitive files (employee accessing HR database)
- Access outside role scope (dev accessing finance folder)
- Pre-termination data hoarding (employee downloads everything before quitting)

**Example Scenario** (undetected):
```
Employee scheduled for termination next week
Downloads 200 customer contracts, 50 financial reports
❌ UNDETECTED - Legitimate credentials, but suspicious context
```

**Recommendation**: Role-based access anomaly detection, contextual risk scoring.

detectConsistentTiming(events: GoogleWorkspaceEvent[]): boolean {
  const intervals = [];
  for (let i = 1; i < events.length; i++) {
    intervals.push(events[i].timestamp - events[i-1].timestamp);
  }
  const variance = calculateVariance(intervals);
  const mean = intervals.reduce((a,b) => a+b, 0) / intervals.length;

  // Flag if variance is suspiciously low (too consistent)
  return variance < mean * 0.1; // <10% variance = likely bot
}
```

### **2. Expand AI Provider Patterns** (1 hour)
```typescript
// In ai-provider-detector.service.ts

    const timeline = userHistory.sort((a,b) => a.timestamp - b.timestamp);

    let currentLevel = 0;
    let escalations = 0;

    for (const event of timeline) {
      const newLevel = permissionLevels.indexOf(event.permission);
      if (newLevel > currentLevel) {
        escalations++;
        currentLevel = newLevel;
      }
    }

    // Flag if 2+ escalations in 30 days
    return escalations >= 2;
  }
}
```
