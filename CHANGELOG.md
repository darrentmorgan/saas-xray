### üéâ **Major Release: Google Workspace Shadow AI Detection**

This release establishes comprehensive Google Workspace integration with enterprise-grade shadow AI detection capabilities, dual OAuth platform support, and real-time discovery experience.

### Added

#### üîê **Google Workspace OAuth Integration**
- Complete OAuth 2.0 integration with real Google Cloud credentials (119529596318-ujgfgc0vgr4jnfjaf5v5l2t6p1l23r7s)
- Metadata-focused scopes for easier enterprise admin approval (admin.reports.audit.readonly, drive.metadata.readonly, gmail.metadata)
- Test user configuration support enabling development and validation workflows
- Enhanced CORS middleware with ngrok subdomain support for HTTPS OAuth development

#### ü§ñ **Comprehensive Shadow AI Detection Framework**
- **VelocityDetector**: Inhuman activity speed detection with configurable thresholds (>1 action/second)
- **BatchOperationDetector**: Bulk automated operation pattern recognition with similarity analysis
- **OffHoursDetector**: Business hours analysis with timezone awareness and holiday detection
- **AIProviderDetector**: Known AI service integration identification (OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere, HuggingFace)
- **DetectionEngine**: Coordinated multi-algorithm analysis with composite risk scoring

#### ‚ö° **Real-time Discovery System**
- Socket.io integration for live discovery progress tracking with WebSocket events
- Progressive discovery stages: Initializing (0%) ‚Üí Connecting (25%) ‚Üí Analyzing (50%) ‚Üí Processing (75%) ‚Üí Completed (100%)
- Professional discovery experience with realistic timing and comprehensive user feedback
- Enhanced DiscoveryProgress component with TypeScript safety and error resilience

#### üîç **Google Automation Detection Scenarios**
- **"ChatGPT Data Processor"**: Google Apps Script with OpenAI API integration detection (High Risk)
- **"Claude Document Analyzer"**: HR document processing with Anthropic Claude API (High Risk)  
- **"AI Integration Service Account"**: Third-party AI automation service identification (Medium Risk)
